# Coffee Chat

List of awesome people offering their time **for free** to have a "coffee chat" with others about different topics, mostly in a mentorship kind of way.

**Important**: this is not a list to promote your paid services. It is like free as in beer...

## Add yourself to this list

To add your name to this list, you need to add another object to the `people` array in [people.json](people.json) and send a pull request. See [schema.json](schema.json) for the information about the JSON schema.

If you have no idea how all this works, you can simply send me your information by [email](mailto:hi@fred.dev), and I'll add you to the list myself with pleasure.

**Warning**: only add yourself to this list!

## Remove yourself from this list

Simply create a pull request by removing your people definition from [people.json](people.json). As for adding yourself to the list if you are not a technical person, just send me an [email](mailto:hi@fred.dev) and I'll do it for you.
